   - **Name**: Full name (auto-generates email)
   - **Course & Year**: Academic information
   - **Status**: Online status

   - **Type**: Location category (lecture hall, lab, etc.)

### 4. View Relationships
Navigate to the **Relationships** tab to see:
- Friend connections between users
- Society memberships
- Event participation breakdown
- Data integrity status

### 5. Export Data
- **Individual exports**: Use export buttons on each tab
- **Complete export**: Click "Export All" for full dataset
- **Validation report**: Export validation results

## Key Features Explained

### User-Friendly Dropdowns
Instead of seeing raw IDs like `user_001`, you'll see:
- **Users**: "Andrea Fernandez"
- **Locations**: "Building 2 Room 04.56"
- **Societies**: "UTS Programming Society"

The interface automatically handles the ID mapping in the background.

### Foreign Key Visualization
Related data is highlighted with blue indicators showing the human-readable names while maintaining proper ID references in the exported JSON.

### EventV2 Format Support
The editor creates events in the enhanced EventV2 format with:
- Two-tier categorization (Category + SubType)
- Comprehensive privacy levels
- User relationships (owner, organizer, attendee, etc.)
- Relative date formatting (`daysFromNow`, `hoursFromStart`)

### Data Validation
Real-time validation includes:
- Required field checking
- Format validation (emails, coordinates)
- Relationship integrity (bidirectional friendships)
- Foreign key validation
- UTS campus coordinate validation

## Best Practices

### Creating Events
1. **Select appropriate categories**: Use the cascading dropdown system
2. **Set realistic times**: Events should have positive duration
3. **Add participants**: Include organizers and attendees for realistic data
4. **Choose appropriate privacy**: Match the event type with privacy level

### Managing Relationships
1. **Bidirectional friendships**: The system automatically validates friend relationships
2. **Event participation**: Users can have multiple roles (organizer + attendee)
3. **Society memberships**: Toggle membership affects member counts

### Data Export
1. **Individual files**: Export specific entity types for targeted updates
2. **Complete dataset**: Use for full demo data replacement
3. **Validation first**: Always validate before exporting to catch issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Validation failed" errors**:
- Check that all required fields are filled
- Ensure email formats are valid
- Verify that selected users/locations exist

**"Foreign key not found" warnings**:
- Load all related data files before creating new entries
- Check that referenced entities exist in the system

**Export issues**:
- Ensure browser allows file downloads
- Check that data validation passes
- Try exporting individual entity types first

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support
- **Requires**: ES6+ support, File API, JSON support

## Integration with UniConnect

### Using Exported Data
1. Export JSON files from the editor
2. Replace corresponding files in `UniConnect/assets/demo_data/`
3. Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
4. The app will use your new demo data

### EventV2 Format
Exported events use the enhanced EventV2 format with backward compatibility. The app's `DemoDataManagerV2` automatically handles both legacy and enhanced formats.

### Validation Integration
The validation rules match those used in the UniConnect app, ensuring data compatibility and integrity.

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Fields
Events support custom fields through the `customFields` property for extensibility.

### Import Sources
Events can be marked with different origins (user, system, society, AI-suggested) for realistic data diversity.

### Privacy Levels
Eight privacy levels supported from public to private with appropriate access control simulation.

### Recurring Events
Support for recurring event patterns with parent-child relationships.
